## About

A simple boinc container built on debian (slim). This container will run the boinc client and by default connect into the world community grid. The default credentials are for richarvey and the weak key is provided. See "Running" for information on overriding these variables.

```
richarvey/boinc:latest - connects to the world community grid
```

It will run out the box with my "weak key" and no customisation.

## Pulling the Container

    docker pull richarvey/boinc

## Running

There are multiple ways to run the container

### Default mode

This will run the container and contribute to the container team:

    docker run -d --name boinc richarvey/boinc:latest

To enable network connectivity in order to use boinccmd or boinc manager from another host:

    docker run -d --name boinc -P richarvey/boinc:latest

Be warned this opens control of boinc up to anyone on the network without a password!

### Custom Project and Keys

To run with your own credentials:

    docker run -d --name boinc richarvey/boinc:latest <YOUR PROJECT URL> <YOUR KEY>

and with networking:

    docker run -d --name boinc -P richarvey/boinc:latest <YOUR PROJECT URL> <YOUR KEY>
